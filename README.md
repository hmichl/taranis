LUA Scripts for FrSKY Taranis Transmitter

Collection of hopefully useful Telemetry Scripts for the FrSKY Taranis X9D(+) Transmitter

- e-segl.lua  for gliders with electric motor
- moto.lua    for planes and helicopters with electric motor

And these scripts are designed to work for the FrSKY Taranis X-Lite Transmitters
Since the display is much smaller than the X9D display, each Telemetry-Screen can have up to four "subscreens". These can be viewed by long-clicking the joystick to one of the four directions.

- xl-seg.lua  for gliders with electric motor
  -- subscreen 1: relevant data during flight
  -- subscreen 2: data to be checked after flights
