LUA Scripts for Telemetry-Screens on FrSKY Taranis Transmitters

Collection of hopefully useful Telemetry Screen Scripts for the FrSKY Taranis X9D(+) and X-Lite Transmitter
Texts within scripts are in German. The program-part inlcuding comments and documentation within the scripts is in English - so everybody being able to understand the scripts should be able to translate the outputs if necessary.

## Taranis X9D(+)
- e-segl.lua  for gliders with electric motor
- moto.lua    for planes and helicopters with electric motor

## Taranis X-Lite
And these scripts are designed to work for the FrSKY Taranis X-Lite Transmitters.
Since the display is much smaller than the X9D display, each Telemetry-Screen can have up to four "subscreens". These can be viewed by long-clicking the joystick to one of the four directions.

- xl-seg.lua  for gliders with electric motor
  - subscreen 1 (up) : relevant data during flight
  - subscreen 2 (right) : data most probably to be checked after flight
